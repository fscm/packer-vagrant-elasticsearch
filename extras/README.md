# Elasticsearch Box Extras

Extra files and templates for the Elasticsearch box.

## Synopsis

The files, scripts and templates found on this folder can be used to extend the
features of the Elasticsearch Vagrant box.

## Getting Started

Download the files required for the extra feature that you want and use them
as described on this documentation.

## Features

### Elasticsearch Cluster

It is possible to use the Elasticsearch box, built with the main recipe, to
create a Elasticsearch cluster.

#### Required Files

To create a Elasticsearch cluster the following files have to be downloaded and
copied to a local folder:

- `Vagrantfile`
- `config.rb.sample`

#### Usage

In order to instantiate a Elasticsearch cluster a few steps are required.

- Copy the required files to a folder.
- Change the name of the `config.rb.sample` file to `config.rb`.
- Edit the `config.rb` file.

Change the value of the variable `elasticsearch_instances_number` to the number
of instances that the cluster should have.

You can also change the internal cluster network addressing space by setting a
new one. To change the default network addressing space change the value of the
`elasticsearch_network_cidr` variable to the desired CIDR notation address.

After all the editing have been done, start the Elasticsearch cluster with the
following command (execute it on the same folder as the files):

```
vagrant up
```

**Note:** If you added the Elasticsearch box, created with the main recipe, to
Vagrant with a different name or if you build your own box with a custom name
you also have to edit the `Vagrantfile.tpl` file and change the value of the
`config.vm.box` variable to the correct name of the vagrant box.
